# unity-coding-conventions
I want my own projects to follow same coding conventions. I wrote this note so I don't have to always google again how something was supposed to be written. Maybe this will give inspiration to you too :)

#### Interfaces
Interfaces are written in PascalCase. Interface starts with "I". For example IAnimal.

#### Methods
All methods are written in PascalCase. For example DoThis().
